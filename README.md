# hubshare

A directory sharing service for JupyterHub.

The goals of this project are to enable simple, coarse sharing of notebooks within a JupyterHub instance.

General goals:

- sharing unit is directories
- publish and download are explicit actions (no sharing in-place)

Explicitly not goals (out of scope):

- In-place or real-time sharing (these are tasks for the single-user server)

This repo is in early development (it doesn't work).

See [specification.md][specification.md] for the planned spec.
